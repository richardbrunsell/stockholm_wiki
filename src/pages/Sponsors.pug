        # Sponsors

        How shall we get financial support with a pandemic during iGEM 2020? This central question
        followed us at the back of our minds during the last months. We iGEM Stockholm 2020 had to
        change some of our tactics to accomplish our aims.

        Especially from a financial perspective, we faced some issues. Long-time investors could
        not support this year’s iGEM Stockholm team anymore. We sent newsletters and the following
        sponsor request to companies in research, but also non-scientific related companies including
        cafés and shops. However, this phase was not successful. Regarding the current restrictions
        in physical meetings, we couldn’t drop into companies, and meetings were not possible. Hence,
        it was difficult to convince potential sponsors to financially support our project. Therefore,
        most of the companies showed no interest.

        We also applied for many grants at our partner universities. Luckily the universities showed
        empathy and understood our situation. For instance, grants that were supposed for traveling
        in the first place, allowed us to pay the registration fee instead. However, as many events
        have unfortunately been canceled, this constricted our budget. This pandemic has taught us
        to bend our ways and be creative to achieve our goals.
        
        Since our whole project relay on sponsors, we are very thankful that our partner universities
        supported us financially during iGEM 2020. Therefore, a special thanks to all our sponsors
        who believed in our idea during these difficult times.
